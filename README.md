INTRODUCTION
------------

Use this module to create a self-hosted note taking app. Benefits of using this
module instead of some external services like Google Keep or Evernote:

 - Keep your private notes to yourself
 - Ability to change and extend the app according to your needs
 - External services come and go, but with this module you are in control

When you install this module, you will automatically get 'Note' content type,
'Labels' taxonomy vocabulary, search API all set up, search view, facets and all
blocks placed. You don't have to do anything, just start creating notes.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

My Notes depends on two other Drupal 8 modules:
 * Search API: https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api
 * Facets: https://www.drupal.org/project/facets


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install the My Notes module as you would normally install a contributed
   Drupal module. Visit https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further
   information.


CONFIGURATION
